We went to see [The Phantom of the Opera](https://href.li/?http://phantomthemovie.warnerbros.com/) tonight and I finally worked out what the story is all about. I’ve seen the stage production twice but didn’t really understand the ins-and-outs of the storyline. Seeing the movie was really good as it helped fill in the missing pieces. For example, I found out about Christine’s father and how he fits into the story, what the ‘Angel of Music’ is all about, how the auction at the beginning of the show fits into the story, etc etc. I highly recommend it.
