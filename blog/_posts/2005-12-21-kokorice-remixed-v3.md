It has taken me over a month in my spare time to complete but I have
already had some positive feedback, which makes it well worth the
effort. I made sure the redesign is accessible in Internet Explorer 5.5/6.x, [Firefox](https://href.li/?http://www.getfirefox.com), [Mozilla](https://href.li/?http://www.mozilla.org) and [Konqueror](https://href.li/?http://www.konqueror.org).
Some highlights of the new site are:

- [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) 2.1.1
- [Zope](https://href.li/?http://www.zope.org) 2.8.4
- [Quills](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/quills) 0.9 final
- The [bowl image](https://href.li/?http://www.morguefile.com/archive/?display=73440&) in the header is from [morguefile.com](https://href.li/?http://www.morguefile.com)
- The site action and external link [icons](https://href.li/?http://www.graphicpush.com/blogicons/) are from [graphicPUSH](https://href.li/?http://www.graphicpush.com/)
- The [favicon](https://href.li/?http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=28684) is from [kde-look.org](https://href.li/?http://www.kde-look.org/)

I
would love to hear anyonesâ€™ comments regarding their impressions on the
