On Tuesday, July 1st, 5:30pm at [3months](https://href.li/?http://www.3months.com)’ offices in [Wellington](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington), New Zealand we had a meeting with many representatives from New Zealand Government to introduce the [PloneGov](https://href.li/?http://www.plonegov.org) project to them. [Joel Burton](https://href.li/?http://plonebootcamps.com) also made a guest appearance (thanks Joel :)) and did an excellent job of introducing [Plone 3](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/3.1)’s features from both the perspective of a user and/or developer. Until then I’d only heard about Joel’s excellent teaching skills but now I can personally say he’s a very engaging and interesting speaker!
We had about 15 attend from the [Ministry of Women’s Affairs](https://href.li/?http://www.mwa.govt.nz), [Ministry of Justice](https://href.li/?http://www.justice.govt.nz), the [Office of the Auditor General](https://href.li/?http://www.oag.govt.nz), the [Treasury department](https://href.li/?http://www.treasury.govt.nz/), the [State Services Commission](https://href.li/?http://www.ssc.govt.nz/), the [National Library](https://href.li/?http://www.natlib.govt.nz/), the [Electricity Commission](https://href.li/?http://www.electricitycommission.govt.nz) and some from the commercial sector. We’ve had good feedback from many who attended and have already begun organising a followup event in the form of NZ’s first [Kiwi Bootcamp and Sprint](https://href.li/?http://www.openplans.org/projects/kiwi-bootcamp-and-sprint-2009/project-home) for around February 2009! Anyone is [welcome](https://href.li/?http://tinyurl.com/plonebootcamp)!
Video’s of both [mine](https://href.li/?http://plone.tv/media/1856753852) and [Joel’s](https://href.li/?http://plone.tv/media/524216883) presentations are available from [plone.tv](https://href.li/?http://plone.tv).
