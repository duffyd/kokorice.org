screening of EP3 worldwide this morning at just after midnight. IMHO
the movie was the best of all the Star Wars movies, with mind-blowing
special effects and action that left me feeling pretty exhausted.
Fortunately, it wasn’t as emotional as I thought it would be, with
Anakin’s turn to the dark side as well as the Jedi’s demise happening
pretty quickly. The only 2 reservations I have about the movie are
firstly that [Anakin’s](https://href.li/?http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/anakinskywalker/index.html) fall to the dark side wasn’t believable enough as after he stopped [Mace Windu](https://href.li/?http://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/macewindu/) killing Chancellor [Palpatine](https://href.li/?http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/palpatine/index.html) and Palpatine’s subsequently offed Windu, Anakin immediately
pledged himself to Palpatine and henceforth started eliminating his
former Jedi friends. Seemed a bit unrealistic. And secondly, that there
wasn’t much of the Wookies in the movie - I was hoping for a bit more
action on [Kashykk](https://href.li/?http://starwars.wikicities.com/wiki/Kashyyyk).

Just a couple of asides: the Clone Wars Parts 1 & 2 animated series
is a must-see for Star Wars die-hard fans and also check out this [fan film](https://href.li/?http://panicstruckpro.com/revelations/revelations.html) (it’s set between EP3 & EP4).
