Miho and I have been married 5 years on May the 5th (this is the same day as the Japanese national holiday, [Kodomo no hi](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodomo_no_hi)). We celebrated our anniversary a ‘bit on the cheap’ on Friday by going to a [local pool](https://href.li/?http://www.qeiipark.org.nz/) and soaking in the spa, steam room, and sauna and generally have a bit of fun. The finished off the day by having a special meal at home - a pretty mellow affair ;-) Coincidentally, Alexander Limi, one of the Plone founders also celebrated his birthday on Thursday.
