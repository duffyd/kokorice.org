![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xg3h_FpT3JbvESky9?embed=1&width=117&height=44)How
about some anecdotal evidence? When I am out [witnessing](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/library/jt/article_05.htm) my lips are so
numb from the cold that I find trouble speaking. Last Thursday, after
opening the shower window to let out some of the moisture, the steam
that had condensed and formed into droplets on the window froze before
it had an opportunity to drop onto the ground! When the wind is cutting
through you like a knife, would you find it easy to think about
anything else? ;-)
On a more positive note, Miho, our friend Mariko and myself went to a Danish bakery today called [Copenhagen Bakery](https://href.li/?http://www.copenhagenbakery.co.nz/)
and were greeted with a taste sensation. I had a Steak & Cheese pie
and a Mixed Berry pie and Miho and Mariko had a Panini each. If you’re
a local and haven’t been yet, I’d highly recommend it.
