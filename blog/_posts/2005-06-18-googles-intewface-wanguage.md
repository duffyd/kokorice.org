My respect for [Google](https://href.li/?http://www.google.com) as an organisation has been slowly increasing bit-by-bit. What with their ’[Summer of Code](https://href.li/?http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html)’ initiative to support [open source](https://href.li/?http://www.opensource.org) software development, it’s really good to see a big IT corporate get in behind open source (I suppose it isn’t surprising as they [already use python](https://href.li/?http://www.python.org/Quotes.html) extensively). Further, something that indicated to me today that they have a sense of humour was the languages they have listed in the ’Interface Language’ option inside ‘Preferences’. Some of the funnier options were 'Hacker’, 'Klingon’, 'Elmer Fudd’, and 'Bowk, bowk, bowk!’. Though, keeping it on these settings can make Google a little harder to use ;-)
