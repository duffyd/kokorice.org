Recently I have been working at a car yard, and I stumbled across a 1973 Morris Marina selling for $2750!!
I don’t think you can exactly call it a vintage and the body isn’t
particularly in pristine condition either, as you can see from the
photos. This is why I buy my cars [direct from Japan](https://href.li/?http://www.ibcjapan.co.jp) and miss out the middle man.
