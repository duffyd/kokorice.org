We took advantage of the glorious weather today and hit [New Brighton beach](https://href.li/?http://www.ccc.govt.nz/Parks/NaturalAreas/pier_recreation.asp) (it was 30 degrees celsius!). We took along some fish and chips from [Dallington Fisheries](https://href.li/?http://www.entertainmentnz.com/christchurch/dining/fast-food/more4.html) and it was perfect; not to mention the crumbed hoki and chips were divine ‘mmmmmmm’.
