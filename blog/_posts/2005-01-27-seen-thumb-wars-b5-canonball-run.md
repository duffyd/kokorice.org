I got my hands on a copy of [Thumb Wars](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb_Wars) the other day from a friend. I am an avid [Star Wars](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars) fan, and I have seen a few [Star Wars Fan Films](https://href.li/?http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/af/spotlight/collections/starwars/) but this has to take the cake. The director, [Steve Oedekerk](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Oedekerk),
has gone to great pains in the special effects, animation, and gags to
make this movie a real classic (a small disclaimer: I haven’t seen the
whole film yet, so don’t blaim me if you don’t like it).

One other sci-fi series that I ‘love’ is [Babylon 5](https://href.li/?http://www.isnnews.net/babylon5/index.shtml). I am slowly making my way through the series on video tape and would recommend it to any sci-fi buff.

We also took part in a real-life [Cannonball Run](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Run)
last Saturday. A friend of ours organised a car rally, which involves
driving all over the city and performing a sheet of objectives, such as
“Who officially opened the Aeroplane Museum”. It was great fun, but
embarassingly we came last :-( We didn’t see anyone else who was doing
the rally during the whole car rally! It felt like we were doing it on
our own! Oh well c'est la vie.

Finally, just a link a friend passed on to me: [http://www.vassfamily.net/ToyotaPrius/CAN/cindex.html](https://href.li/?http://www.vassfamily.net/ToyotaPrius/CAN/cindex.html)

Is there nothing a [Sharp Zaurus](https://href.li/?http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/15/linux_4gb_hdd_pda/) can’t do! The Japanese are really smart :-)
