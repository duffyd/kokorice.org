Nothing much to report today but something I did want to mention is

 something close to my heart (&amp; to another part of my body :) - Japanese

 toilets. Something they have over here (&amp; something I’ve actually known

 about for some years) is the automatic toilet (don’t know the official

 name). This visit to Japan is the first time I’ve had the courage to use it

 but man I wish I’d tried it sooner. As you can hopefully make out in the

 picture there are 3 buttons. One is for lightly spraying a jet of water at

 your behind to clean it, a 2nd for cleaning it a bit stronger, &amp; a final

 button for drying it afterwards. I tell you I don’t wanna go back to normal

 New Zealand toilets after this - absolute heaven (BTW there is a lot more ‘heaven’ to enjoy in Japan other than the toilets).
