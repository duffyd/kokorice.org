**[CERN](https://href.li/?http://home.web.cern.ch)**: European Organisation for Nuclear Research.

Potentially setback 3 years if test failed as can take 3 months to run test.

CERN: 5 million data points.

For every 8hrs of testing need 40hrs of testing with multiple platforms.

[Squish](https://href.li/?http://www.froglogic.com/squish/gui-testing/): automation tool which integrates with QT.

Benefit of using Python: “1 support person taking support requests for 20 developers”.

**Q&A**: How do you speed up the particles? Acceleration through magnets.

“SPS goes down every Wednesday for upgrades”.

Why do you need to support all these platforms? “Political thing”. As many developers in Unis around the world using different platforms.
