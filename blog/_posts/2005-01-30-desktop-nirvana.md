After much procrastination I finally installed my [Nvidia](http://www.nvidia.com) graphics card and got it working under [X Windows](https://href.li/?http://www.xfree86.org/), [KDE](https://href.li/?http://www.kde.org) 3.3 and [Debian](https://href.li/?http://www.debian.org) (unstable). An invaluable reference in my trials was a [Debian Kernel Compile HowTo](https://href.li/?http://www.desktop-linux.net/debkernel.htm) which as the title suggests also provides instructions on how to upgrade your kernel to 2.6. Further on in the howto it addresses how to get a Nvidia graphics card working as well. A big thank you to the anonymous author of this howto! Another page I found which looks helpful (though I haven’t read it indepth) is this [one](https://href.li/?http://www.linuxtimes.net/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=457). Further, a caveat for newbies (like me ;-) is mentioned [here](https://href.li/?http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2005/01/msg01522.html). The long-and-the-short of it is that if you want to use dpkg-reconfigure (which provides easy wizard style configuring of your Debian system) then *never* edit your configuration files manually.
An interesting quote I found the other day, which I think aptly describes the struggles that many linux users have said this:
“One of the great things about Linux is that you really get to educate yourself as a user .. you will not only have the
satisfaction of a custom built system but also gain the insight to how
the system works.” (From [Linux Times](https://href.li/?http://www.linuxtimes.net))

P.S. I now also have a working scroll mouse! Simple pleasures ;-)
