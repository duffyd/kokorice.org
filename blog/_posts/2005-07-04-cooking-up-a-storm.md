Translation (German): ‘What did I bake in the Knapp bakehause’.
I’ve been so busy over the last week-or-so - mainly preparing a [public lecture](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/library/jt/article_05.htm) for last Sunday. Over that time I baked a few items, namely some ginger crunch, a couple of chocolate cakes, and I just finished baking some oat cookies. All of my critics, of which I am foremost, thought the fruits of my labours were great.

Update: I forgot to mention that I also made some caramel corn.
