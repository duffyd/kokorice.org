Just finished a marathon viewing of [Pride and Prejudice](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice_%28BBC%29) which started
last Saturday evening. As I’m a ‘blokey’ type of guy and will tend to
always opt for a Sci-fi movie over a 'girlie flick’ I didn’t think it
would be my cup of cha but I’m happy to say that I really enjoyed it.
It was a very well written and constructed story and also touched a few
heart strings in the process *sob*, *sob*.

I would highly recommend it to anyone as a 'few’ hours well spent.

BTW last week I also finished off a [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) site for a customer - [check it out](https://href.li/?http://www.englishtutor.co.nz).
