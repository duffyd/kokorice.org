I don’t know whether you could compare it to one skilled
tradesman constructively critiquing another or not but being on the
receiving end of someone visiting my door with a religious message was
educational. It did help me to see what it would be like for those [we](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org) call on. Some things that did put me off a little was having 3 sisters standing at my door and there opening line was “We are missionaries, have you ever met a missionary before?”. It was also a little frustrating that I said I was a devout Christian in the opening couple of minutes but was still listening to their sermon 30 minutes later :-(
On the positive side, though, they were a positive bunch and it wasn’t an altogether unpleasant experience talking to them.
