I had my bro come down and stay with us over the weekend - he went back to [Auckland](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland) yesterday. He’s come all the way from [London](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) to [NZ](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewZealand) for a few weeks and it was great to see him again. We spent most of the weekend relaxing with one highlight being my public talk at the Samoan congregation and a toonai (Sunday meal) afterwards with some of the bros. The toonai consisted of [taro](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro), cooked bananas, [corned beef](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corned_beef), raw fish in coconut milk and ‘lots and lots’ of other yummy stuff - it had been a while since I’d had a good Samoan feed. Yesterday we went to the [Canterbury Museum](https://href.li/?http://www.cantmus.govt.nz/), which was very interesting, especially the information about the early English settlers in Canterbury, the displays showing Maori life of times past and a full Samurai suit. We also spent about an hour wandering around [Willowbank](https://href.li/?http://www.willowbank.co.nz), and I got to see 'close-up’ my first Kiwi!
