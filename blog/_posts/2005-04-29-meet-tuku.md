I’m currently enroute to Christchurch from Rotorua, writing this entry with a crystal clear view of [Mt Ruapehu](https://href.li/?http://www.mtruapehu.com/) from my window seat ;-) Nothing too techo here, just writing on my pda to copy/paste later. I spent yesterday at a [conference](https://href.li/?http://www.hewakaekenoa.org.nz/) promoting our [Te Reo Maori](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maori_language) version of [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/), which we’ve called Tuku. It means ‘website’ in Maori, which loosely defines what it can do & implies it supports Maori (feel free to say what you think of the name). Did some networking @ the conference, notably meeting [Vaemu Fidow](https://href.li/?http://blog.core-ed.net/vaemu/) (who actually was responsible for me being there via a [blog entry](https://href.li/?http://blog.core-ed.net/vaemu/archives/000671.html) on his site), a work colleague of his, [Hemi Waerea](https://href.li/?http://www.core-ed.net/mt/hemi/), Ateremu, [Kingi Gilbert](https://href.li/?http://www.ignitestudios.org/) & some others. Here’s hoping there’s some interest in Tuku (I might post my presentation notes for folk to look at if anyone’s interested).

***Update***: Here is a [link](https://href.li/?http://www.thevirtual.co.nz/hwen-conference/) to the Tuku presentation slides and notes. Enjoy.
