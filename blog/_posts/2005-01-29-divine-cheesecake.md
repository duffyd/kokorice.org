I highly recommend [Divine Cakes and Deserts](https://href.li/?http://www.divine.co.nz) for absolutely delicious cheesecakes, etc. Miho organised a linen party for a friend in preparation for her wedding and one of the invitees brought a coffee & chocolate cheesecake/mousse from there - it was heavenly :-)
Also played some basketball (another passion of mine) with some friends today and realised how unfit I am.
