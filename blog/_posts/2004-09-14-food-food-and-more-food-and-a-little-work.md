This past weekend was vundabar. On Friday night we had dinner at a friend’s
 house and had some culinary delights from the sea. This friend + family are
 keen fishermen. Check this out for an awesome spread:

- Appertiser - smoked trout & cream cheese on crackers, steamed
 mussels.
- Main - cooked crayfish, battered blue cod, some South African curry
 (hot, hot, hot) + rice, a meat dish of sorts, nice salad, and wine to wash
 it all down.
- Desert - pavlova, chocolate mousse (this was a killer), ice cream, and
 fruit salad.

 It still makes the mouth water when I think of it now. Ahhh sweet
 memories.

 Then on Sunday we had some Japanese friends over and had [nabe](https://href.li/?http://www.japaneserestaurantinfo.com/page068.html).
 Apparently it means pot and it implies you cook it in (you guessed it) a pot
 in the middle of the table with your friends & family gathered round. It
 was fun, though we had sheep’s heart in one of the dishes & it was
 edible but ‘really’ chewy?! Tough hearted beasts :)

 Today I spent most of the day trying to find an [
 ISP](https://href.li/?http://www.netguide.co.nz/shopping/directory/index.php?directory=highspeed#listfocus) in New Zealand that will give me a sub-$100 high speed ADSL
 connection including a static IP address. Is it too much to ask? Well
 apparently so. Oh to be back in Japan where you pay about $50 a month for a
 flat-rate ADSL connection at 50Mbps! For those who are newbies to ADSL
 technology, most NZ ADSL connections are around 256Kbps! Oh well, such is
 life. We also spent some time finishing off a customer’s website ([http://www.minamiweddings.co.nz](https://href.li/?http://www.minamiweddings.co.nz))
 and doing 'stuff’. Something else that was a highlight today - [TheVirtual Ltd](https://href.li/?http://www.thevirtual.co.nz) (and me, well as a
 founding member :) launched the New Zealand Zope User Group. Check it
