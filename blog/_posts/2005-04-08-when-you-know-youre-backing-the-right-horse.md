It’s true that when you’re looking for the bad in something you will find it but these [admissions](https://href.li/?http://drupal.org/node/290#comment-3192) came from [Drupal](https://href.li/?http://drupal.org) users! I did read about the whole Drupal vs Plone [argument](https://href.li/?http://drupal.org/node/13733) via a [post](https://href.li/?http://awkly.org/archive/blog_78630) on Sidnei da Silva’s [website](https://href.li/?http://awkly.org). and basically it came down to [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) is more of an enterprise CMS whereas Drupal is more suited to smaller scale implementations (I stand to be corrected on this - I really should turn on Anonymous commenting ;-)
The thing that started me comparing the 2 systems was an email from a client that pointed me towards a new Pasifika community [website](https://href.li/?http://www.canterburypasifika.org.nz/pasifika/) in Christchurch. We’re starting to get heavily into internationalising Plone and coming across this website that’s specifically targeted at the Pacific Island people in Canterbury was a project that screamed “Plone”. I discovered after a bit of digging that the website is based on Drupal and thought I’d do some further digging to see what Drupal’s [i18n](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I18n)-support was like. I discovered that Drupal has around 28 [translations](https://href.li/?http://drupal.org/translation-status) in progress, whereas Plone has [43](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/development/teams/i18n/existing-translations). The real distinguishing factor, though, is Plone’s [multilingual content](https://href.li/?http://www.plonesolutions.com/products/linguaplone) support, which means you can have content available simultaneously in multiple languages. Imagine being able to simply view the same document in the language of your choice, whether that’s Samoan, Tongan, Fijian, Maori, English or whatever other language you like - that’s the kind’ve functionality Plone provides! I hope I can convince others about this amazing feature that Plone has..
