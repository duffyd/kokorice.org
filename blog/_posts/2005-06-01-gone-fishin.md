got round to taking a friend up on his invitation to join him fishing
on his boat. I was up at 5:30am and at his place by around 6:30am as we
wanted to be on the water early. It was just as well because the sea
was really rough and only afforded us enough time to get 6 fish (2 of
which I caught) and 6 crayfish. The boat ride also revealed to me that
I don’t have ‘sea legs’ but fortunately I didn’t [hurl](https://href.li/?http://encyclopedia.laborlawtalk.com/Vomiting).
