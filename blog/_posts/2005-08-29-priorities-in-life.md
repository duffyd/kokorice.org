It’s amazing that multi-millionaire, [Howard Hughes](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes), appeared to have it all - money, fame, women, success - but it didn’t seem to bring him genuine happiness as he had a life fraught with problems, such as poor mental health, broken marriages, and legal battles. It really brings home to me that these things don’t bring happiness but that we have a need to find meaning in our life, which you could call a spiritual need. In fact that thought is borne out in this [wise man’s](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ) [words](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/bible/mt/chapter_005.htm#bk3).
