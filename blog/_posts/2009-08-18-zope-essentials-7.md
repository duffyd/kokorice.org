I gave a [presentation](https://href.li/?http://www.slideshare.net/knappt/getting-all-your-web-apps-to-wear-the-company-brand-jp) at [Zope Essentials 7](https://href.li/?http://zope.jp/events/zopeessentials/7/zope-essentials-7) in Japanese regarding [Deliverance](https://href.li/?http://deliverance.openplans.org/), the new flexible theming technology for [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org). Funnily enough, 2 years earlier, I also attended and presented at [Zope Essentials 6](/), so this was as much a resurrection of the event as an opportunity for me to present again to the local Plonistas.
17 attended including myself and following my presentation I fielded a number of questions from the attendees, which was a good indicator of the level of interest in the technology. Following my presentation, [Takanori Suzuki](https://href.li/?http://takanory.net/) gave a lightning talk regarding eggifying an existing Zope 2 product using [ZopeSkel](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/zopeskel) and [setuptools](https://href.li/?http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools). In his presentation he used his [PloneSlimbox](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/plone-slimbox) product as an example. After this, [Takeshi Yamamoto](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/foundation/members/tyam) presented regarding his efforts to translate the [eduCommons](https://href.li/?http://educommons.com/) project into Japanese, and finally Manabu Terada gave a brief talk on accessibility in Japanese Plone-based websites.
A special thanks to [Jay Hotta](https://href.li/?http://www.cybertron.co.jp/) for helping organise the event, to [Manabu Terada](https://href.li/?http://www.cmscom.jp/) for MCing, to the [JZUG](https://href.li/?http://zope.jp) for supporting it, and to [ASCII MediaWorks](https://href.li/?http://asciimw.jp/) for hosting.
