I had a chance to put some faces to names when I met up with [Pete Simmons](https://href.li/?http://www.bcmpweb.com) and Michael Dunstan, who are some [Zope](https://href.li/?http://www.zope.org) gurus based in Auckland. Our meetup took 3 hours and we covered various topics, including [Selenium](https://href.li/?http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/index.html) and [ArchGenXML](https://href.li/?http://www.google.com/search?q=archgenxml) amongst other things. Weâ€™re planning to meetup again this coming Wednesday and there will also be an ex-[Zope corporation](https://href.li/?http://www.zope.com) developer coming along, which should be interesting. Pete will also take us through a more indepth ArchGenXML tutorial.
