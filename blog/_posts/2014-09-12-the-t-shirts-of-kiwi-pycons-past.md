As I was packing for Kiwi PyCon last night I did something I’ve wanted to do for some time and that was take photos of all the Kiwi PyCon T-shirts to date.

Matthew Allen or ‘mata’ is the creative genius behind all of the designs bar the 2012 T-shirt. My personal favourite is 2013’s design. In fact, there’s a story behind every design. If you’re lucky I may just explain what it is. Looking forward to seeing what mata has done this year!

Kiwi PyCon 2014 started today with all the tutorials and CodeWars. Unfortunately I couldn’t make either but looking forward to the conference proper starting tomorrow.
