Went and watched [Shark Tale](https://href.li/?http://www.sharktale.com/) tonight
 with some friends and I really enjoyed it.

 It seemed like the film directors wanted to give it a real homeboy-type
 flavour to the movie, and for that reason Will Smith was cast well as the
 main character - Oscar. I’d give it a 8/10 for viewing pleasure and it did
 put a ‘smile on my dial’.

 Also, I’ve just put a [photo
 album](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhA1hwR0uEL13r-7t?e=e7fGxk) on this website with some picies of our Chihuahua puppy -
 Chocolat. Check it out and be jealous :)
