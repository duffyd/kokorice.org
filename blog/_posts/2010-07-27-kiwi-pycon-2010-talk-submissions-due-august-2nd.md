If you haven’t heard, [Kiwi PyCon 2010](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org) is to be held in the beautiful [Bay of Islands](https://href.li/?http://www.bay-of-islands-nz.com/), just outside the Waitangi Treaty grounds at the [Copthorne Hotel](https://href.li/?http://www.millenniumhotels.co.nz/copthornebayofislands) on the weekend of November 20-21.
So far we’ve had 6 financial sponsors commit to the event and 6 [schwag sponsors](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/2010/sponsorship/sponsors/), which puts us in line for an excellent event with a substantial grab bag of goodies the likes of which any IT professional would drool over.

On the talk content side of things, [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://href.li/?http://jacobian.org/), co-founder of the [Django](https://href.li/?http://www.djangoproject.com) project, will give Saturday’s keynote, [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) will be presenting and [Weta Digital](https://href.li/?http://www.wetafx.co.nz) have also got a couple of their team coming along, just to name a few. If you’d like to have your name alongside this impressive lineup, the due date for talk submissions is this coming Monday, August 2nd so head on over to [http://nz.pycon.org/submit-talk](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/submit-talk) today and get submitting and help contribute to the success of Kiwi PyCon 2010!
