Some good friends of Miho’s and now of mine have come to stay for a few days. They moved to Malaysia to teach the Bible to people there. [Malaysia](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia) is an interesting place, though, as it’s a moderate Islamic state with about 60% of the population professing to be [Muslims](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim). The [statistics](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/statistics/worldwide_report.htm) also bear this out. Therefore they need to be disreet when engaging in their Bible education work. They’re having a great time over there, though, and it has been great having them stay.
