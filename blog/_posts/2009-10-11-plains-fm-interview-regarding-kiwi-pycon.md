## What is Kiwi PyCon?

To **promote** the use of the **programming language Python** in New Zealand the NZ Python User Group (NZPUG) is holding the first Kiwi PyCon conference in Christchurch at the Canterbury Innovation Incubator on November 7th and 8th.

## What is Python?

Its an open source programming language that is very simple and flexible to use. In New Zealand, Weta Digital use it to produce the special effects and animation in movies such as King Kong and Lord of the Rings. YouTube runs on it and Google rely on it for their day-to-day operations, just to name a few companies who are making use of Python.

## What’s going to be on the conference programme?

The event will include talks highlighting how Python has been used in web and desktop applications, in the field of science and maths, in gaming and animation, and in various other fields.

The main keynote speaker at Kiwi PyCon, Joel Burton, an internationally recognised trainer and presenter, will explain how Python is becoming the language of choice for developing websites.

The conference has also attracted a lot of interest from many universities throughout the country and staff and students from Auckland, Massey, Canterbury, and Otago universities will be presenting regarding how they’ve used Python in their research.

There will also be an unconference part of the event where delegates will be able to give short 5 minute presentations regarding how they’ve been able to benefit from Python. So it will be a very interactive event for everyone.

## How can people find out more about the event?

Head over to [nz.pycon.org](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org). We’re expecting **150** delegates from across New Zealand and Australia. We’ve had **115** registrations thus far and registration closes on October 23rd so get in quick so you don’t miss out.

The event has also only been possible due to the generous support of our sponsors: Canonical, Catalyst IT, Weta Digital, the Python Software Foundation, Unfold Limited and Tait Electronics. As well as Encode Limited, powerHouse, PretaWeb, VortexDNA and the Plone Foundation.
