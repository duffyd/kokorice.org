Two Sundays ago Miho and I watched ’[Finding Neverland](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.M._Barrie's_Neverland)’ and it got me thinking about my experiences as a youth. It filled me with a bit of nostalgia, gave me ‘warm fuzzies’, and had me wishing those days were here again. I suppose not all of us have good memories of our childhood but it does shape who we are today, and in my case anyway it was a simpler, less complicated time. While I was reminiscing I decided to compile a list of the movies, music, tv programmes, sports stars and other things that shaped my youth. Here are some of the things I recall (in no particular order):
Tron, Condorman, Bros, MC Hammer, Milli Vanilli, Mel and Kim, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Earvin 'Magic’ Johnson, Ardijah, MacGyver, Dukes of Hazard, CHIPs, Knight Rider, Streethawk, Gummi Bears, Smurfs, The Muppets, Nintendo, Double Dragon, Galaga, Stubbies, KC and the Sunshine Band, Star Wars, Pick-a-Path Books, Lego, He-man.
