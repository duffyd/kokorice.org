It’s a bit hard to recount everything we’ve done thus far but I’m gonna give
 it a go (with pictures :)

 Well, got here on the 9th of August and had a few dramas :(

 Firstly our bags got lost in transit (don’t worry got them back) & then
 just about didn’t meet our ride.

 On 10th met up with a fellow zopista called [Michiharu Sakurai](https://href.li/?http://mojix.org/) & had a yarn & a
 coffee (or kohi in the local lingo).

 [Zope](https://href.li/?http://zope.org/) is concerned in Japan. He also started
 the local [zug](https://href.li/?http://zope.jp/) as well.

 On Thursday 12th enjoyed some ‘hanabi’ or fireworks with some [Jehovah’s Witness](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/) friends. ![image](https://dm2301files.storage.live.com/y4mgeOjP2bghAah4IQxG0uIpSEnSFq0dt06NleF-p3lC0GN79WUrDa2XELS22xwdxYkaA4Gqn4oFYoiFhfqHk0GjHgoi_h-9mziSQQLtYWP4m9P8Ub5qGbTj8EOmD3Z7m48tg-Tet6pgeJZuvincAHULV5Jpr3t9nNtZA0wrHGYKdasoqVrnMDdDFZi5hWlkG2d?width=240&height=180&cropmode=none)

 On 14th went to Ikebukuro where we checked out some gears for our Chihuahua,
 & after that went to Shibuya which is a 'very’ popular hang out for
 young people in Tokyo. When I was there I saw a ridiculously priced water
 melon.![image](https://dm2301files.storage.live.com/y4mkXCUMUH5HOw8BHozTuol9u2-edpipdDO3xDlelYWCfkUIA6vEmSqpKELge6azUHT2EX8cl__nMp-exORj-H36arajaL_ui84KOacNATk-8mVHH7kidPoZNNj5i_nGIQSubFeLsn0VWYQNxbZ8EhU6L8UsreDTQyQTZttbhJK0Cq_CCNo01yhJHCEQHy47ik0?width=240&height=180&cropmode=none) You can’t really make it out in this
 photo but I’ve magnified the price. It reads 63000 yen, which in New Zealand
 dollars is about $1000!

 On our way out of Shibuya we were also able to 'finally’ meet up with some
 'kigurumi’. These are people who dress up as cartoon characters. Check it
 out - ![image](https://dm2301files.storage.live.com/y4mkxCOOMaVO-imCT3jajzjEzFF3vVPxA0i7fnl-um7d6lzH4FGL1ZNgnZGFBFeeVg4JLip8e1vIYs06OZXdOygafw6dXDGIQT4vhaMMT1j5Ewq5A9SJgQzcLJ1u6Uq5tSAWcL3yfvDV5iKXkZozKTKDb_9-faf9TaHD0L0omPgsyJzKBLo-b4OXMFsD3kWA6fq?width=240&height=180&cropmode=none)

 Got to Miho’s parents hometown of [Sendai](https://href.li/?http://www.city.sendai.jp/index-e.html) on Monday 16th
 & met the folks & also a new addition to the family - maro. ![image](https://dm2301files.storage.live.com/y4mn_Jy2TtO62bowGEWIuQ3wzliBKoinRYxcy2Nb0qMycMD3lfW0WxLxW3j-HcR1-5f3O82ESUE9-IJhQ-NaFtNI5ACTC7iSNFugF4fJeXrFZcKhq3xCAHk3GDZDQTpyTg2FUMyMkhihn7kbNVSqGa3zJB9TzNYObtLx3Ihu04glqsH8BA3exBPGUYPDEQvSR5I?width=240&height=180&cropmode=none) I hope our one is as cute :)

 As a final entry check out this shop that we found in Sendai. Man you gotta
 laugh at the english names they choose for things over here - crazy! ![image](https://dm2301files.storage.live.com/y4mLiI6wcCvtFg4ejd2oe7VpHfjagX_uIYDx0xBQkpKtOj53zXl2CSkq2wRKdEoS9KoMhjpRDdDd2kZ6d2W4ynfgN75DIURQo6Xf_HMQM1L_QaY0I1oToN4wuLwyikPiJBZ19CbsfbI6SscueKeVZ6BirCRuFrZM8L_sYKRTHAoMCbuXKxP8ZpAiqxP7a5al6rK?width=240&height=180&cropmode=none)
