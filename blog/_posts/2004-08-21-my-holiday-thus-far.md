It’s a bit hard to recount everything we’ve done thus far but I’m gonna give
 it a go (with pictures :)

 Well, got here on the 9th of August and had a few dramas :(

 Firstly our bags got lost in transit (don’t worry got them back) & then
 just about didn’t meet our ride.

 On 10th met up with a fellow zopista called [Michiharu Sakurai](https://href.li/?http://mojix.org/) & had a yarn & a
 coffee (or kohi in the local lingo).

 [Zope](https://href.li/?http://zope.org/) is concerned in Japan. He also started
 the local [zug](https://href.li/?http://zope.jp/) as well.

 On Thursday 12th enjoyed some ‘hanabi’ or fireworks with some [Jehovah’s Witness](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/) friends. ![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhB6FbmE02YF-cZpS?embed=1&width=240&height=180)

 On 14th went to Ikebukuro where we checked out some gears for our Chihuahua,
 & after that went to Shibuya which is a 'very’ popular hang out for
 young people in Tokyo. When I was there I saw a ridiculously priced water
 melon.![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhCBB26vvlQN0XiMi?embed=1&width=240&height=180) You can’t really make it out in this
 photo but I’ve magnified the price. It reads 63000 yen, which in New Zealand
 dollars is about $1000!

 On our way out of Shibuya we were also able to 'finally’ meet up with some
 'kigurumi’. These are people who dress up as cartoon characters. Check it
 out - ![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhBZs9Dtse9F4RK-D?embed=1&width=240&height=180)

 Got to Miho’s parents hometown of [Sendai](https://href.li/?http://www.city.sendai.jp/index-e.html) on Monday 16th
 & met the folks & also a new addition to the family - maro. ![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhBVxB2s7MaDQgDZA?embed=1&width=240&height=180) I hope our one is as cute :)

 As a final entry check out this shop that we found in Sendai. Man you gotta
 laugh at the english names they choose for things over here - crazy! ![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhA_Lc8dHC8VAmPT5?embed=1&width=240&height=180)
