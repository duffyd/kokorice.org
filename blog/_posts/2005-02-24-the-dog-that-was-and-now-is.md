A week ago, we were at the tail-end of the worst 2 weeks of [Chocolat’s](/2004/09/24/touch-down/) life. She had been having really bad seizures, a couple of which lasted for over 7 hours! Last Tuesday we had to take her to the vet after she had been seizuring all day and he had to give her a shot of [valium](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valium) to calm her down (this wasn’t the first time she had had a shot of this). The following day, on Wednesday, she had an ultrasound scan of her brain to confirm whether or not she had [hydrocephalus](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus). When her scan was compared with a typical text book hydrocephalus scan it was identical. This was good and bad, because now we knew for sure that she had hydrocephalus but this also meant that it was incurable. The vet said to us that we needed to consider seriously whether or not we would put her down if her condition continued to worsen. At the same time, though, we decided to double her dose of steroids that she was taking to help her brain drain out the excess [cerebrospinal fluid](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid). And to our surprise, after doing this her condition improved a hundredfold. From last Thursday until today she hasn’t had a seizure and she is healthier than we’ve ever seen her. Chocolat is back!!
