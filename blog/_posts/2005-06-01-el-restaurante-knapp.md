on Sunday morning. After liasing with Mum I prepared them as follows: I
boiled them until red, cut them in half down the middle of their belly
and cleared out the ‘poo sack’; put some cheese on top and grilled
them. We also garnished them with a special sauce, which consisted of a
tablespoon of flour, half a cup of milk, half a cup of cream, and a
cube of melted butter. The 'taste sensation’ was absolutely divine. I
also had a third attempt at making an [apple pie](/2005/05/23/the-samoan-chef/) and this time I 'hit the jackpot’! Our guests also said the apple pie was 'delicious’.
