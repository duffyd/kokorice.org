We saw [Spanglish](https://href.li/?http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/spanglish/) on Tuesday night and I thoroughly enjoyed it (apart from 1 dodgy scene, which I evaded). Funnily, enough, I could sort’ve relate to [Flor](https://href.li/?http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6700296/site/newsweek/) when she was learning English (except that she seemed to pick it up crazily fast), as I had to go through the process of learning Japanese and it was great when I could finally speak it. I think it was nice too how the storyline didn’t predictably finish in true Hollywood fashion but had an almost ‘moral’ twist at the end.
