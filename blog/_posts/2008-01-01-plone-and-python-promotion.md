We’ve been back from [Taiwan](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taichung) about 4 months now, and the trip was well worth it. I met some fellow [FOSSers](https://href.li/?http://www.tossug.org/), bought a [geek toy](https://href.li/?http://www.openmoko.com), and did some [Plone promoting](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/events/community/plone-presentation-at-taipei-open-source-software-user-group-meeting/). On that note, I finally got around to posting a [video](https://href.li/?http://plone.tv/media/997950722/view) of the presentation I gave at the TOSSUG meetup on [plone.tv](https://href.li/?http://plone.tv).
Interestingly, Taiwan has had a [Python User Group](https://href.li/?http://wiki.python.org.tw/) (PUG) around for quite some time and this has been the rallying point for Python developers in Taiwan. They don’t currently have enough [Zope](https://href.li/?http://zope.org)/[Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) developers to start a user group specifically targeted at this developer segment but one idea we discussed was to promote Zope/Plone by way of the PUG.
Here in [New Zealand](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), as far as I’m aware, the first official Python-related user group to start up was [NZZUG](https://href.li/?http://nzzug.org). In recent times, [Danny Adair](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyadair) has started up the [New Zealand Python User Group](https://href.li/?http://nzpug.org) (NZPUG) and they have already had their [first meetup](https://href.li/?http://groups.google.com/group/nzpug/browse_thread/thread/3a177bbe4398ed3). This is great to see and I hope to be able to give a presentation at one of their upcoming meetups.
