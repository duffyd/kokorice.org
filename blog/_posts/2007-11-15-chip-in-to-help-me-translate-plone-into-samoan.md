Initially, a bit of background - about 2.5 years ago, [myself](https://href.li/?http://www.emergetec.com) and another Plone consultancy took the [initiative](/) to begin translating Plone into [Maori](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language), [Samoan](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoan_language), and some other Pacific Island languages. Unfortunately we were denied [funding](https://href.li/?http://www.ma-tereo.co.nz/) for translating Plone into Maori (apparently Microsoft New Zealand had already created a bilingual CMS for the Maori Language Commission on the then pre-release MS CMS 2002) and as none of us were native Maori or Pacific Island language speakers and therefore not able to translate Plone ourselves the project stalled.
Recently, though, I’ve made a decision to start translating [Plone 3.x into Samoan](https://href.li/?https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTranslations/trunk/i18n/plone-sm.po) myself. It’s a little slow going as I am not a native Samoan speaker (though I have Samoan heritage :)), but I am making good use of a Samoan dictionary and some [online resources](https://href.li/?http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-PraDict-c3-1.html). I thought particularly with the end of year approaching and the inevitable slow down in work that happens over the holiday period I would ask the community if they would pledge any money towards my translation efforts over the holiday period (and therefore also contribute to my continuing to eat over the holiday break :)), so we can have another ‘shiny translation’ in Plone!
If you’d like to pledge any funds towards my translation efforts, click on this [chipin for a Samoan Plone](https://href.li/?http://duffyd.chipin.com/translating-plone-into-samoan) link. Thanks!
