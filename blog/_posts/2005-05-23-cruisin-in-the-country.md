![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xg3a9YEGpByi90mGw?embed=1&width=200&height=150)We went country [witnessing](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/library/jt/article_05.htm) today and had a glorious time. We were closer in towards the [Southern Alps](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Alps)
where the temperature today felt about 20-something degrees. I was
complaining about the excessive heat! It had a very peaceful, relaxing
feel about it and was a nice change.
