I had the honour of giving the first [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) [speech](https://href.li/?http://www.openfoundry.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=969&Itemid=189) at the [Academia Sinica](https://href.li/?http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en_frame_aboutus.htm) in Taipei, Taiwan recently. TsungWei Hu, who arranged for me to give the speech, manages the [Open Source Software Foundry](https://href.li/?http://www.openfoundry.org/) (OSSF) project, whose key objectives are to promote Open Source Software in Taiwan. TsungWei mentioned that he had been meaning to ask [Paul Everitt](https://href.li/?http://www.zeapartners.org/about/pauleveritt) to give a speech regarding Plone at the Academia Sinica (Paul - hint, hint) but hadn’t, so I got in first ;-)

The [first](/) of which was in Tokyo, Japan, and the [next](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/events/community/plone-presentation-at-taipei-open-source-software-user-group-meeting/) was for the [Taipei Open Source Software User Group](https://href.li/?http://wiki.tossug.org/) (TOSSUG). At the TOSSUG meetup I was able to meet [Sean Moss-Pultz](https://href.li/?http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/speakers/sean+moss-pultz) and [Harald Welte](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Welte) of the [OpenMoko](https://href.li/?http://www.openmoko.org) project. Sean is the General/Technical Manager for the OpenMoko project, while Harald is the Lead System Level Architect. As I’m an Open Source fan and enjoy hacking my own computer, I’m really excited about what Sean, Harald and the rest of the [OpenMoko Core Team](https://href.li/?http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Meet_the_Core_Team) are doing as mobile phones in general are pretty much closed devices nowadays.
