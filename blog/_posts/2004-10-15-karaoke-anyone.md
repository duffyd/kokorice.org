Just got back from a barbi with [friends](https://href.li/?http://members.msn.com/captrev@hotmail.com) and there I
 found the most enjoyable, fun device I have ever seen in my whole life. It
 was a [PS2 game](https://href.li/?http://www.singstargame.com/en_NZ/home.html)
 that basically is karaoke but it also tests you to see if you are singing in
 tune. You can go head-to-head with a friend and whoever is the most in tune
 wins. For someone like myself who has a passion for singing this game was
 heaven!
