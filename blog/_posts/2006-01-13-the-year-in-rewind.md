- **Mariko’s Farewell Party**. Good food, fun games, good food, Japanese conversation, good food, great association, good food.
- **Nicola’s Farewell Party**. A good friend headed over to the [Dominican Republic](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic)
for 6 months to teach the Bible. The evening was a formal affair and
consisted of an assortment of yummy dishes, ballroom/latin/rock'n'roll
dancing, and some [chinwag](https://href.li/?http://www.allwords.com/word-chinwag.html).

We all enjoyed the abundance of seafood and I got in a lot of fishing while we were there.
- **New Congregation**. January 1, 2006 was a new start for us in [Hallswell](https://href.li/?http://www.zoomin.co.nz/christchurch/riccarton/wrights+road/) [congregation](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/library/rq/article_14.htm). We’ve been supporting the Chinese group there for some months now so thought it was about time for us to move in.
