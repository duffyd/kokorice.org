Caught up with a [friend](https://href.li/?http://www.quitestrange.com) from Auckland on Monday night and here’s a snippet from our conversation:

    (21:10:16) Runs With Scissors: So have u adapted to the cold?
    (21:10:27) duffyd: errr, not really. Don’t think I ever will
    (21:10:27) Runs With Scissors: and auckland bashing?

It’s true that in [Christchurch](https://href.li/?http://www.christchurchnz.net) there is a real rivalry with [Auckland](https://href.li/?http://www.aucklandnz.com/), though funnily enough there doesn’t seem to be much the other way. I remember when we first moved down here (about 2 years ago now) we kept it quiet that we were from Auckland because we knew about the [parochialism](https://href.li/?http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/parochial.html) down here.
On this note, just the other day I was driving along and saw quite a funny billboard. It read something like this: “What does a sheep and an Aucklander have in common? They both get drenched”. Madness ;-)
Miho has a wall ornament that emphasises what is *really* important: “Home is where your honeys are”. Basically it doesn’t matter where you live, if you’ve got friends and loved ones around you, it’s all good.
