I’ve been looking for a good Internet Radio station for years now and finally stumbled across [one](https://href.li/?http://somafm.com/listen/) via Tom Lazar’s [blog](https://href.li/?http://tomster.org). Not that I endorse all the music on their station but I do like what I’ve heard so far. I’ve discovered my work background music.
