We try to regularly set aside a day just for us, though, it has been about a month since we last had one. We started off by doing some shopping at [Dressmart](https://href.li/?http://www.dress-smart.co.nz/Auckland/index.asp), where Miho bought 3 items and I bought 1. From there we went to [Mt Eden](https://href.li/?http://mounteden.co.nz/), where we paused for a coffee and pancakes at [Frasers](https://href.li/?http://www.streetsite.biz/index.cfm?fuseaction=guest.home&hp=10087). Then it was on to Auckland city for a browse, topped off by dinner at ‘The Koreans’ - an absolute must for fans of Korean BBQ. Incidentally I must express thanks to the Morita family for generously shouting us dinner.
