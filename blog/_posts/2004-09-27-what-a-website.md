I’ve finally given a much needed face-lift to my [company website](https://href.li/?http://www.emergetec.com)! It also makes use of
 some great [Zope](https://href.li/?http://zope.org)  and [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) technology called i18nlayer, i18nfolder,
 and PloneLanguageTool which are available at the [Collective](https://href.li/?http://sourceforge.net/projects/collective) (i18nfolder
 is available at the [
 Ingeniweb Products](https://href.li/?http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74634&release_id=159278) section on sf.net). This technology enables you to
 very easily create and edit website content in many different
 languages and also allow visitors to the website to easily navigate the
 website and view content in either language (there is an excellent tutorial
 on [Tom Lazar’s
 website](https://href.li/?http://tomster.org/geek/plonezope/i18n-howto) - BTW he’s a really good guy too). As a developer it is very
 easy to use and as a visitor it is easy too - a win-win situation :) The
 site is still a work-in-progress so I will be sprucing it up a bit more in
 the near future. Keep tuned.

 As you can see I’ve also updated the look on kokorice too. It now has a
 little more of a cocoa / caramel feel to it. It was also inspired in part by
 our new chihuahua puppy who is a caramelly colour too :)

 Just a last rant regarding Internet Exploder, the bane of my existence. One
 issue I discovered when trying to finish off emergetec.com was that in
 Internet Explorer 6 there was a gap above and below the image I had set as a
 background on the top banner section of the site. It looked fine in [mozilla](https://href.li/?http://mozilla.org) (and why wouldn’t it ;) I found that
 when I removed the [height](https://href.li/?http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_dim_height.asp) attribute
 the problem disappeared (go figure). Dunno what the reason was but I’m just
 happy the problem is resolved. Hopefully someone else can benefit from my
 headache ;)
