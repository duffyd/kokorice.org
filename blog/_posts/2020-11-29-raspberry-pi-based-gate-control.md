I recently built a React web app running on a Raspberry-Pi to control our front gate. It also has a simple Homebridge interface allowing it to be controlled by Siri. You can checkout a video demonstrating me using Siri to control the gate here:[![video 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/S4w9_sjCGm0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4w9_sjCGm0) and a video of the setup can be viewed here:[![video 2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Krv31PiC-50/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krv31PiC-50). Finally the git repository is [here](https://github.com/duffyd/gatecontrol).
