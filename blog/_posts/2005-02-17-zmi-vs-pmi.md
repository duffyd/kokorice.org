Yesterday I was implementing a solution for a customer based on a [howto](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/documentation/howto/random-photo-portlet) at [plone.org](https://href.li/?http://plone.org), and I was struggling to get the thing to work. In the end the problem was related to the fact that I had created the [CMFPhoto](https://href.li/?http://www.contentmanagementsoftware.info/plone/cmfphoto/) content through the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) rather than through the Plone Management Interface (PMI) - bad mistake. I was told this lesson long ago but had to learn it again the ‘hard way’. When you add stuff through the PMI it does a whole lot of other workflow-type stuff/etc in the background.
Also I learned a cool command in [google](https://href.li/?http://google.com) today - allinurl:my_url. For e.g. type allinurl:weblog_view in the google search box and it will find all urls that contain 'weblog_view’ - which just happens to be all [Quills](https://href.li/?http://developer.etria.com/projects/quills) weblogs. Cool ay.
