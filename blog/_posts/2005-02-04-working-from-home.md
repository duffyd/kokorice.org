I just had an [ice cream truck](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream_van)
pull up right outside my house so I wandered out and bought one. The
ice creams came to me! So I can work in the comfort of my own home and
have the luxuries of a mall.

**Update a little while later**
Oh and don’t forget I can drink beer and work too. Only on Friday afternoons mind you ;-) (I wouldn’t recommend the mixing of the two though *yuck*).
