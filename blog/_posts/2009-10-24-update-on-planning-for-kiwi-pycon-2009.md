Its exactly 2 weeks until [Kiwi PyCon 2009](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org) and preparations are all in hand for a really great event. We’ll be releasing another media statement the week of the conference to remind the media about the event and also to get a last bit of advertising out there about the event.
Registrations closed yesterday but we actually sold out the event about 4 days before the registration closing date, showing the great amount of interest in this event, not only in New Zealand but throughout the world. We’ve got registrants coming from all around New Zealand, from across the ditch in Australia and even from as far away as England.
I’ll be sending an email reminder out to all delegates the week of the event with some conference tips courtesy of [EuroPython 2009](https://href.li/?http://wiki.europython.eu/ConferenceTips) and also with a little bit more information about the event.
All the organising has come off really well too. The T shirt design, compliments of [Matthew Allen](https://href.li/?http://www.mata.co.nz), will blow the socks off most other technical conferences worldwide (but hey I’m biased). The T shirt order has also been submitted to the screenprinter for printing. The conference programme design, thanks to Michael Dunstan, has been pretty much all done and will be on its way to the printer come early next week. Even the menu for the 2 days of the conference has been vetted by [Nathan Torkington](https://href.li/?http://nathan.torkington.com) and Jenine Abarbanel.
We’ve got a last planning meeting with the [Kiwi PyCon 2009 Team](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/about/team/) this coming Tuesday at 1pm and following that its just counting down to the big day. For those who are registered, see you all there on November the 7th!
