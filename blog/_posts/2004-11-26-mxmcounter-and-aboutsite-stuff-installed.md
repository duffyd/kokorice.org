I decided to give some more TLC to my blog site so I’ve installed [mxmCounter](https://href.li/?http://www.mxm.dk/products/public/mxmCounter/) and some
 [scripts / zpts](https://href.li/?http://www.misner.de/tech_info/) I received from
 [Kay Misner](https://href.li/?http://www.misner.de/). Many, many thanks go out to
 these guys for producing these programs and especially to Kay for being so
 helpful in emailing me the ‘stuff’ and promptly providing excellent
 instructions. To access the new features have a looksy at the footer. The 6
 digit number is the mxmCounter and if you click on the [Colophon](/about/) link, you will be able to access the info
 regarding this website. Enjoy :-)
