Exhibit A on my right is my office setup at home. Here’s a run-down of what it cost me:
$0.00 Monitor (gift from customer :-)
$0.00 Mouse (gift from customer :-)
$N/A Crufty keyboard (too old to be of any value ;-)
$0.00 Palmpilot (hand-me-down from old job)
$0.00 Mousepad (freebie from computer conference thingee)
$50.00 Canadian Oak Desk (generous contribution from a Canadian pal)
$29.99 Chair ([Warehouse](https://href.li/?http://www.thewarehouse.co.nz) jobbie)
$0.00 My high-tech speakers (some cheap headphones)
$0.00 Operating System ([Debian](https://href.li/?http://debian.org) - open-source yay!)
$100.00 Computer (can’t remember exactly but was cheap anyway)
_______
$179.99 TOTAL

You too can have a setup like this if you’re stingy and have got generous friends ;-)

BTW we also pre-enrolled at [CPIT](https://href.li/?http://www.cpit.ac.nz) today for a beginners chinese course because we’d like to help teach Chinese people the Bible. I loooovvveee language!
