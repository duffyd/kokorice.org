Iâ€™ve got an Irish friend who passed this [ditty](https://href.li/?http://www.answers.com/topic/ditty) on to me:

> > The Scots are famous for keeping the Sabbath and everything else they can lay their hands on.
The Welsh pray on their knees on Sunday and on everyone else all through the week.
The Irish do not know what they want but they are willing to die for it.
The English are a race of self-made men thereby relieving the Almighty of a dreadful responsibility.
