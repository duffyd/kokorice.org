Haven’t blogged in a while ‘cos things have been so hectic of late. Here’s a
 run-down on what we’ve been up to:

- Last Wednesday (17 November) it was confirmed by our veterinarian that
 our [Chihuahua
 puppy](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhA1hwR0uEL13r-7t?e=e7fGxk) has [hydrocephalus](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus). We
 knew that it had had the condition when it was an infant but we thought it
 had grown out of it but last week it was having more and more frequent
 seizures, which is a definite symptom of this illness. It’s not all doom
 and gloom, though, because she is on a course of steroids which seems to
 have all but eradicated the seizures.
- We moved house last Friday! Finally after a year-and-a-half
 house-sitting we’ve moved into our own place! The house is [wundabar](https://href.li/?http://www2.dict.cc/?s=wunderbar), it has everything we
 wanted and need: washing machine, comfortable/trendy design, TelstraClear
 cable connection :-), pretty gardens, wooden floors (so if the pup does
 some 'surprises’ on the floor they’re easy to clean up :-), etc etc. The
 move also went really well. It really proves to me the Christian love that
 exists amongst [Jehovah’s Witnesses](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org).
 We had a couple of friends do pretty much the whole move starting at about
 7:30 in the morning. When we arrived at our new place at about 11am all our
 gear was already there! So we finished the actual move by 12:30pm (we
 started at 10am!). Next we started unpacking the boxes and by the end of
 the day the house was basically totally setup. What a great move :-)
- I’ve also been doing some work with [LinguaPlone](https://href.li/?http://www.plonesolutions.com/products/linguaplone)
 lately for an English language tutoring centre. The software is great and I
 take my hat off to Alexander Limi and the [team](https://href.li/?http://www.plonesolutions.com/about/team) at Plone
 Solutions. I’ll hopefully have a preview of it for you in the near
 future.
- Also found a really great article today which combines 2 of my
 passions: coffee and Plone. It has a really good explanation about Plone
 and its use in a cafe environment (interesting). [
 Check it out](https://href.li/?http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/personaltechnology/2002089837_ptploning13.html).
- And finally and definitely not least I bought a wireless/router [
 linksys](http://www.linksys.com/international/product.asp?coid=21&ipid=452) combo thingee today. There’s some really cool [firmware upgrades](https://href.li/?http://www.sveasoft.com/) that can’t turn the
 device into a repeater! Free wireless communities!!
