Today I [biked](https://href.li/?http://www.wises.co.nz/map/?d=0&id=65650%7C2%2C+67565%7C2&svctype=4&routemethod=0) a distance of about 3kms to a Bible study, and I was thinking to myself as I biked along that Christchurch is a great city for cyclists. If I had to bike a similar distance in Auckland, I’d probably be in serious pain but in Christchurch, as it’s so flat, it’s a breeze. Incidentally, the comment on [this website](https://href.li/?http://www.bugpacific.com/christchurch/) concurs with my thoughts ;-)
