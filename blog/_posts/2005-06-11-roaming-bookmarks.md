I installed [TastyBookmarks 1.5](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/atbookmarks/releases/1.5), which according to the [project homepage](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/atbookmarks) is a online bookmark management tool, much like [del.icio.us](https://href.li/?http://del.icio.us). When this product is combined with the [Firefox](https://href.li/?http://getfirefox.com) [Bookmarks Synchronizer](https://href.li/?https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=14) it has the wonderful benefit of allowing you to ‘roam’ from computer-to-computer and have your browser bookmarks follow you. Here are some caveats I found while setting this up on my site.

- The [link](https://href.li/?http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/booksync) to the Bookmarks Synchronizer product in [Nan](https://href.li/?http://www.nan.objectis.net)’s README.txt is incorrect. The correct link is [here](https://href.li/?https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=14).
- I had to manually type ’upload_xbel_form’ at the end of my TastyBookmarks folder url to view the xbel import form as there wasn’t a visible link to it.

P.S. Just as an aside, as I was contemplating an appropriate description for this post I recalled a TV show I really liked when I was young called ’[The Littlest Hobo](https://href.li/?http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-4625/)’. It was great! Does anyone else recall this show?
