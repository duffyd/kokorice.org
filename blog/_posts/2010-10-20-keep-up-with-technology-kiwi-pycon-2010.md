IT folks will certainly be interested in Kiwi PyCon 2010: An exciting and interesting weekend is going to show how the programming language Python is used in science, education, and high-profile companies here and around the world. It is held at the Copthorne Hotel & Resort in Waitangi, Bay of Islands Saturday 20-Sunday 21 November.

Participants will learn first-hand how Weta Digital uses Python in their datacentre, or how they can leverage cloud computing like Amazon web services and Google App Engine. The conference is also an excellent networking opportunity to meet people who have actually delivered, from industry to education to government sectors to Hollywood.

The registration fee ($100 regular, $60 student/unwaged) includes morning and afternoon tea, as well as lunch on both days, the Kiwi PyCon 2010 t-shirt, and there are also tons of giveaways this year, ranging from books, laptop bags and geek gadgets to software licenses for Python IDE’s and Amazon server credits.

An impressive sponsorship lineup includes Catalyst IT and Microsoft as Gold Sponsors; Atlassian, Enthought, the Plone Foundation, the Python Software Foundation, and Tait Radio Communications as Silver Sponsors; and Schwag Sponsors: Amazon Web Services, Wingware, Mozilla, ActiveState, Apress, Packt Publishing, O'Reilly, ThinkGeek, ANZTB, and Bitbucket.
