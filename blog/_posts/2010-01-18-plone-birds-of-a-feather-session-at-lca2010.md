I’m organising a [Plone Birds of a Feather session](https://href.li/?https://conf.linux.org.au/wiki/PloneBoF) at [LCA2010](https://href.li/?http://www.lca2010.org.nz). It’ll be on [Wednesday, January 20th from 14:30-15:15](https://href.li/?https://conf.linux.org.au/wiki/BOFs) in Civic Suite 3 (which is apparently in the Old Town Hall building). Topics up for discussion will include:

- Plone 4 and Beyond
- E-Commerce in Plone
- Interconnectivity with RDBMSes
- Plone Theming
- Plone Support in NZ
- Etc

essentially whatever anyone would like to discuss.

So if you’d like to find out what [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) is all about or talk some nitty-gritty regarding some specific aspect of the Plone CMS, come along this Wednesday and have a chat (I have asked that those coming along also list their names on the [Plone BoF wiki page](https://href.li/?https://conf.linux.org.au/wiki/PloneBoF) or drop me an email, just so we’ve got a bit of an idea of numbers).

More information is available here: [https://conf.linux.org.au/wiki/PloneBoF](https://href.li/?https://conf.linux.org.au/wiki/PloneBoF).
