We had a farewell party for a Japanese friend last night at [Tokyo Garden Christchurch](https://href.li/?http://www.destination-nz.com/barrestaurant-t22/christchurchcanterbury-r55/ad.html?advertid=1228).
The food was great just a shame that they don’t provide rice with their
set menus (*grizzle grizzle*). I find it is something you get used to
with Japanese friends who come on a working holiday or for study, they
are always coming and going. We could pretty much go anywhere in Japan
and have people to stay with! That’s one of the great benefits of
having an [international brotherhood](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/languages/languages.htm) :-).

We’ve also got some other friends (whom we stayed with during our stay in Japan [last year](/2004/08/25/dousanko/)) going back to Japan tomorrow. *Sigh*, as I said, you get used to it ;-)
