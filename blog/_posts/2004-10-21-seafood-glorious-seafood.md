Just did a round-trip to [Kaikoura](https://href.li/?http://www.kaikoura.co.nz)
 where we got 5 crayfishes & 200gm of whitebait - yum yum. Just consumed
 2 of them tonight. Mumsy is down & she made whitebait fritters (a NZ
 tradition!) and also cooked the crayfish in a special cream sauce - it was
 divine. When we were in Kaikoura we went to a restaurant called Pipi’s &
 had an award-winning seafood chowder (it won best food item at the [Kaikoura Seafest](https://href.li/?http://www.seafest.co.nz/)), and I definitely
 concur that it was a vundabar spread. Also had a pot of steamed
 mussels/clams/pipis - pure heaven.

 We bought our crayfish from a place called Nin’s Bin - about 20mins north
 of Kaikoura. Not bad quality crayfish & also averagely priced.
 All-in-all a day all seafood lovers (including myself) will not want to
 forget.
