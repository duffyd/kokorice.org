Martin Luther King was pushing for equality when he uttered those famous words and it really does echo well the struggle for equality of the Pasifika languages on the internet. That is one major issue that I will be addressing during my stay in Auckland.
It is really encouraging to see that the government in its ’[Digital Strategy](https://href.li/?http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/)’ is intent on providing funding for the creation of websites with Pasifika language content. Our software, [Tuku](https://href.li/?http://www.thevirtual.co.nz), is designed for just such a purpose and was the motivation behind our translating [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) into Maori, Samoan, and Tongan. Here’s hoping local government and community groups will use Tuku to create Pasifika language websites; after all it’s free!
