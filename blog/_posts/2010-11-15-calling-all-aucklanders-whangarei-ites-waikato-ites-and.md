This weekend at the [Copthorne Hotel](https://href.li/?http://www.millenniumhotels.co.nz/copthornebayofislands) in Waitangi is [Kiwi PyCon 2010](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org). We’ve got a great lineup of speakers including Jacob Kaplan-Moss - the creator of the [Django](https://href.li/?http://www.djangoproject.com) web framework, speakers from Weta Digital, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Catalyst IT, to name a few.

If that hasn’t motivated you to come along, we’ve also arranged a [charter bus](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/2010/nov/3/bus-route-changed-now-airport-pickup/) leaving from Auckland airport, Auckland University, and Massey University campuses for a ‘cheap as chips’ return ticket price of $20! The bus leaves Auckland this Friday at midday and returns Sunday night. Seats are still available so [get in](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/submit-registration) before the last minute rush!

The bus will arrive just in time for our Friday night [CodeWars](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/2010/nov/12/friday-night-kiwi-pycon-codewars/) event, pitting 8 teams of developers against eachother in a 3 round competition. The winners will get a grabbag of schwag. There’s lots of schwag on offer the whole weekend, though, with giveaways ranging from software licenses, geek gadgets, MSDN subscriptions, t-shirts, laptop bags, books, etc.

Tickets are **$60** for **students**/unwaged and **$100** for **everyone else**. Morning/afternoon tea and lunch is included. Accommodation can be organised by dropping an email to [kiwipycon@nzpug.org](https://href.li/?mailto:kiwipycon@nzpug.org).
