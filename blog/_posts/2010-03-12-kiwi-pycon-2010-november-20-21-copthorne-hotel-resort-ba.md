Expect the same great lineup of talks regarding how Python is being used in the fields of science, maths, games, animation, web development and much much more.

 Again we’ll have a couple of world class keynote speakers and an ‘unconference’ aspect to the event where you, the delegate, can get involved.

Add to all this the fact that it’ll be in the beautiful [Bay of Islands](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Islands) at an [excellent venue](https://href.li/?http://www.millenniumhotels.co.nz/copthornebayofislands/) and we’re set for an even better event than last year.

Keep an eye on the [conference website](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org) for updates as planning for the event unfolds.
