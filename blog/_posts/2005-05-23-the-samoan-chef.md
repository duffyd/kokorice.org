You may have guessed from perusing the entries on this blog that I love food. I think in Japanese they call it ’tabemono ni urusai’ (well that’s how Miho often describes me). I’m very particular about what I like and also really enjoy cakes and deserts so this gives me motivation to bake. I made my first apple pie last Saturday night from a recipe an Irish/English elderly friend gave me. Her apple pies are delicious and also very healthy as she worked as a dietician for years. Unfortunately, although I followed the recipe to the letter, the pie lacked sugar so came out a little bland. Next time I’ll make sure it tastes better.
I’ll chuck up a ‘recipe corner’ on this site with some recipes I’ve tried out for your baking pleasure.
