I got to the check-in desk about 10 minutes before departure and as a result had to pay $145 for another ticket and wait 3 hours! I suppose it wasn’t a total loss, though, as I was able to finish my presentation for the [PBT](https://href.li/?http://www.pacificbusiness.co.nz/) [Business Networking Club](https://href.li/?http://www.pacificbusiness.co.nz/?pid=34) this evening and therefore pay for some of my fare ;-) It didn’t help my grumpiness much (add to that a lack of sleep), although a [Wendy’s](https://href.li/?http://www.wendys.com) combo for lunch should help there.
