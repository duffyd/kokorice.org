We had a very special Japanese meeting today - our first public Bible discourse AND [Watchtower](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org)
study in Japanese! A visiting brother from Japan (Tadao Hayakawa and
his wife Yumiko) gave a Bible discourse regarding meditation on
spiritual matters. This is our first ‘real’ meeting in Japanese and was
a fun affair. Until now we have only been having the Japanese
Watchtower study every 1st and 3rd Sunday of every month but from next
month we will be having the Japanese Watchtower on just the 1st Sunday
of every month. We will also be visiting Japanese speaking people in
Christchurch on this 1st Sunday too, so we look forward to getting into
this work.

We also had a surprise party for the honeymooning couple who are
staying with us at the moment, Keiko and Keisuke Yanno. We spent a very
nice week with them when we went to Japan in August and are repaying
the favour now by having them stay with us. The surprise party was
organised by some friends in St Albans congregation and we had a 4
course meal and it was a splendifirous time, with friends and
socialising a plenty.

We also just got back from a 3 day trip to [Blenheim](https://href.li/?http://www.destinationmarlborough.com/) and [Nelson](https://href.li/?http://www.nelsonnz.com/). We left on Wednesday (3/11/04) and arrived in Blenheim that night and stayed at the [Cherylea Motor Lodge](https://href.li/?http://www.cherylea.co.nz),
which I would recommend to anyone! We stayed in Unit 18 which was
basically a 3 bedroom house, just awesome! The next day we travelled to
Nelson via Picton and stayed that night (4/11/04) at the [Milton Chalet Motel](https://href.li/?http://www.miltonchalet.co.nz/),
which was comfortable and adequate. The following day we did a little
sight seeing around Nelson and then headed back after doing a must see
stop at the [Macs Brewery](https://href.li/?http://www.macs.co.nz/) - I tell you that was grand :-) though a bit expensive ($10 for a tour plus beer tastings!).
