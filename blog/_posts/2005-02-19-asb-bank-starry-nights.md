I love singing and hence I love musicals. We went to [ASB Bank Starry Nights](https://href.li/?http://www.summertimes.org.nz/2005/StarryNights.asp) for the 1st time tonight and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It wasn’t as big an affair (say around 100,000 people) as something like the [SKYCITY Starlight Symphony](https://href.li/?http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/events/starlight/default.asp) in Auckland (maybe around 300,000) but the talent on display was great. I’d recommend it to anyone who is a fan of live shows.
