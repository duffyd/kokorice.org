Decided to ‘finally’ setup an RSS feed for this website. You can point your
 [news reader](https://href.li/?https://netnewswire.com) at
 [http://kokorice.org/rss.xml](/rss.xml) and 'Bob’s your uncle’ you’re enjoying
 syndicated kokorice.

 In Plone it is a simple case of clicking the 'Enable Syndication’ button in
 the [portal_syndication](https://href.li/?http://www.tchezope.org/traducoes/lp/ingles/5)
 tool in the ZMI. A 'Syndication’ tab will then become visible in all
 folders, which will allow syndication of the folders contents. Simple as pie
 :-)
