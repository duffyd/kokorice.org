Had the [Circuit
 Overseer’s](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/library/jt/article_07.htm) visit this past week. It was a really nice week but was at
 the same time sad ‘cos Sandy Pannell’s mum is dying of [leukemia](https://href.li/?http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/all_page?item_id=7026).
 She has already gone on a morphine pump, so she hasn’t got long to go. I
 also had my first meetup with a guy who has asked for a Bible study. He is a
 maori guy called Nuka and I’m looking forward to going through the [Require brochure](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/library/rq/index.htm)
 with him.

 Miho is also going up to [Auckland](https://href.li/?http://www.aucklandnz.com/)
 today to pick up our Chihuahua puppy (a.k.a. Chocolat). So they’ll be
 pictures to come and also lots of laughs.
