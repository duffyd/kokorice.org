4 of our windows on one side of the house were smashed, and a pane of glass on our front door has a couple of sizable cracks in it. Fortunately 2 of the smashed windows are in the kitchen, which isn’t a room we generally spend a lot of time in during the day. Also the other 2 windows that were smashed were on double-glazed windows so this wasn’t a major either. I took a small video of the lightning storm and will post this up later.

***Update***: As promised [here](/) is a movie I took of the storm.
