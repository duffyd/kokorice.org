We’ve been going for about a month now but we’re both still really enjoying it, though I think Miho is much more motivated than I am. We’re going to a night class every Monday night for a couple of hours from 5-7pm, and we’re also going to a course organised by the Halswell Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses every Sunday - so double-dose! After we do our lesson on Sunday, we visit Chinese-speaking people in Christchurch and engage in a Bible teaching work. I think being able to practise by speaking to Chinese people is really helpful. The written side of the language is tough, but the language itself is relatively easy - I would recommend it as a language to try out!
