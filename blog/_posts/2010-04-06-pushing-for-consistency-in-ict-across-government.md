**NEW ZEALAND PYTHON USER GROUP**

**Media Statement**

**April 6, 2010**

**IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

Currently a number of different content management systems are being used across government with most departments working independent of each other.

Therefore all government departments are invited to a seminar to showcase how the enterprise content management system, Plone, is being used in a number of government departments locally as well as in Australia.

“A coordinated approach to ICT web services seems to be missing in New Zealand” says event director, Tim Knapp. “Many of the government departments I’ve spoken to are in dire need of an organisation that can provide independent advice on open source web technologies, particularly as there’s so many to choose from. Australia are far ahead of us on this front, where they’ve setup the Open Source Business Cluster to fill this need”.

Mr Knapp goes on to say “Plone is particularly suited to government as it is an enterprise-level content management system, exceeds the E-government standards for government websites, and therefore was officially sanctioned by the State Services Commission back in 2005”.

The New Zealand Python User Group, is organising this free event - World Plone Day, on April 28th from 12:00pm at The Treasury department’s offices in Wellington. All those interested in attending are encouraged to register on the event’s website.
