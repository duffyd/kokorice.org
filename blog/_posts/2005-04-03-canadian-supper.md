 delights and didn’t leave disappointed, with sweet potato, butternut squash
 topped with mixed spice and sugar being a highlight along with a yummy
 cottage cheese flan. That aside, though, we did discuss the she’ll be
 right approach to life that New Zealanders have as opposed to your
 typically more focused Canadian; though, there are advantages to both
 approaches. Funnily enough there was even a little confusion over what we
 were being invited for, as the word ‘supper’ in New Zealand refers to a
 snack enjoyed after dinner but in Canada it refers to the dinner itself. An
 amusing website I found, which explains some more Canadian vocabulary is [here](https://href.li/?http://www.cornerstoneword.com/misc/cdneng/cdneng.htm).
