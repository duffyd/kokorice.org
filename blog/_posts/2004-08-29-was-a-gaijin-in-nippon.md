Yes, it’s sayonara time, unfortunately. Today we went to [
 Asahikawa](https://href.li/?http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/kokusaikouryu/index/index.html) & had the best [
 ramen](https://href.li/?http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=ramen&meta=) I have ever had in my life. It was called ‘chashu shouyu ramen’
 & is basically slowly cooked pork in soy sauce soup. I tell you the pork
 was sooo tender it melted in your mouth (mmmmmm). We also went to Asahikawa
 Zoo which was interesting, especially the collection of animals from
 Hokkaido.

Its been a fun trip, & has been interesting seeing the way others in
 the world do things differently. It does make this world an interesting
 place to live.
