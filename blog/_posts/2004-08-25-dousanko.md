Dousanko is the name of someone who was born in Hokkaido and this is
 where we are at present, although it took us a 15 hour ferry trip to get
 here. The ferry trip wasn’t too bad but the beds were like small capsules.
 This is my first trip to Hokkaido & it’s beautiful. Reminds me a lot of
 New Zealand. Lots of greenery & animals (bears, foxes, racoons,
 dragon-flys, etc, etc). On Tuesday we had a look around the main city here,
 [
 Sapporo](https://href.li/?http://www.welcome.city.sapporo.jp/cgi-bin/odb-get.exe?WIT_template=spETOUR_PCOLLECT), & on Wednesday we went to the 2nd beautiful lake in Japan
 (sorry forgot the name).

Hokkaido-ben is the name of the dialect of Japanese spoken by people in
 Hokkaido & as I’m quite interested in this dialect I’ve learnt a few
 words. They are as follows:

- Namara = very. E.g. namara ii (very good).
- Tsupe = snot (this is probably not worth remembering).
- Hankakusai = stupid.
- Azumashii = comfortable.
- Menkoi = cute.
