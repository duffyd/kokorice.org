I’m currently recovering from [food poisoning](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_poisoning) after spending most of yesterday with vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and tiredness. The food poisoning came on seemingly after I ate some day old rice we got from an Indian restaurant (needless to say I’m not going back there again). Today is just a recup-day and hopefully will be back to 100% by tomorrow.
