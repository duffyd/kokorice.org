Just watched the first episode of a 8-or-so part Japanese drama tonight. It had [Takuya Kimura](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takuya_Kimura) in it (or kimutaku for short) and was great, though I had to concentrate hard (and get help from Miho) to understand it. I really do admire the Japanese for the engaging storylines they create for their dramas and am still to find an equally engaging English drama. I suppose this also explains why so many Japanese seem to be addicted to dramas.
