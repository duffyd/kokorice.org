My presentation also included a demonstration of creating a [UML model](https://href.li/?http://argouml.tigris.org/) for a simple Plone content type and associated workflow and then using the code generator, [ArchGenXML](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/archgenxml), to create the product. I also demonstrated some of the benefits of using [Instance Manager](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/instance-manager) while doing Plone development. Following my presentation, [Jonathan Lewis](https://href.li/?http://www.lewis.soc.hit-u.ac.jp/) gave a report regarding what was achieved at the recent [Sorrento sprint](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/events/sprints/sorrento-sprint-2007/).

About 30+ people attended and it was really encouraging to see the enthusiasm for [Plone in Japan](https://href.li/?http://plone.jp), where Plone appears to be experiencing a similar surge in popularity as New Zealand and other countries around the world. Many thanks to Shigeo Honda who organised the event, [WiseKnot](https://href.li/?http://www.wiseknot.co.jp/) who provided the venue (and beverages), those who helped me prepare the presentation, and all those that turned up to listen to the presentation.

Prior to our leaving for Japan, on February the 16th, we had a [Plone Meetup](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/events/community/new-zealand-plone-user-group-meetup-in-auckland/) ‘New Zealand-style’ where 6 of us met at a [Malaysian restaurant](https://href.li/?http://www.viewauckland.co.nz/review_2996.html) and discussed the progress of [Plone in New Zealand](https://href.li/?http://www.nzzug.org), some [Python](https://href.li/?http://www.python.org) and [Zope](https://href.li/?http://www.zope.org) technologies, some Flash front-end goodness, and some friendly Microsoft Vs Google banter. I’ve received some nice feedback regarding the meetup so thanks for that and thanks to those who were able to attend and also those who were there in 'spirit’ :-)

Some of you may know that Shibata-san is responsible for the Plone Blogging product, [CoreBlog2](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/products/coreblog2). Shibata-san has been pioneering the use of Plone/Zope in Japan for some time now and it was nice to discuss with him the progress of Plone in Japan and some of the challenges Japan faces going forward. I’m sure we both came away from the meeting enlightened and it is always nice to meet another Plonista!
