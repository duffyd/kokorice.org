Miho and myself watched a Chinese movie tonight called [Together](https://href.li/?http://www.togethermovie.com/) (in English anyway ;-) It was a really nice movie about a really talented young musician who with his father moves to Beijing to find ‘fame and fortune’. It’s a 'feel good’ movie as it emphasises that family is more important than success. This movie follows on the heels of another movie we saw at our Chinese course at [CPIT](https://href.li/?http://www.cpit.ac.nz/) last Monday - [The Road Home](https://href.li/?http://www.allmovieportal.com/m/2001_The_Road_Home77.html). This was another feel good movie, which highlighted the gulf between modern Chinese and older 'pre-Communist’ Chinese and a sons learning to understand his parents.
