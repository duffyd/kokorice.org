The folks were down from Auckland last week and we went to [Hanmer Springs](https://href.li/?http://www.hurunui.com/information/hanmer/) last
 Friday for a day trip. We stopped at the Springs Deli Cafe for one of their
 famous arty coffees. I like to think of myself as ‘a bit’ of a coffee
 connoisseur and I thought their coffee was 'average’ but the presentation
 was grand (as you can see).

 Also, I went out and bought [Nesian
 Mystik’s](https://href.li/?http://www.nesianmystik.com/) CD last Saturday and had a good old laugh at their taking off
 of Samoans (I can laugh cos I’m half). The group is really talented, and it
 illustrates what islanders can achieve when they put aside their petty
 differences and combine their talents (much like the Pacific Island rugby
 team).
