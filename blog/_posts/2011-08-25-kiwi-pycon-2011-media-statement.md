NEW ZEALAND PYTHON USER GROUP INCORPORATED

Media Statement                    August 23, 2011

IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Calling all IT geeks and tech-savvy people!

Kiwi PyCon 2011, New Zealand’s conference dedicated to the Python programming language, is on this weekend at Te Whaea in Wellington. With a great lineup of speakers from Weta Digital, GitHub, a strong local and overseas contingent, as well as three international keynotes, there is still time to participate in this fantastic conference.

On Friday night there will be “CodeWars”, a fun event pitting eight teams of developers against each other in a three round competition. Saturday night will feature a conference dinner, and on Sunday morning a special women’s breakfast has been planned.

Friday night’s “CodeWars” as well as the weekend’s Kiwi PyCon conference will offer lots of giveaways ranging from software licenses, geek gadgets, t-shirts, books and loads more. Tickets are $60 for students/unwaged and $100 for everyone else. Morning/afternoon tea and lunch is included.

The event has garnered notable support, with the Python Software Foundation, Catalyst IT, Signify, the Plone Foundation, and Web Drive as major sponsors and many other well known companies including Enthought, GitHub, Mozilla, Tymar Systems Development, Weta Digital, and Tait Radio Communications all backing the conference.
