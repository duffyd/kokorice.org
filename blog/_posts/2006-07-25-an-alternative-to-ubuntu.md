I recently installed [Ubuntu](https://href.li/?http://www.ubuntu.com) on a desktop computer at work and do like it but as Ubuntu uses [Gnome](https://href.li/?http://www.gnome.org) as its Window Manager and I’m a [KDE](https://href.li/?http://www.kde.org) fan (unsure whether this is due to my familiarity with the desktop environment or its extensive feature set), I was still seeking a version of Ubuntu that used KDE instead of Gnome. I was already familiar with [Kubuntu](https://href.li/?http://www.kubuntu.org) but had heard from a few friends that it had bugs so I wasn’t that keen to try it out. Then one of my company’s suppliers told me about [Mepis](https://href.li/?http://www.mepis.org) and that it uses the same repositories as Ubuntu and best of all it uses KDE!
I installed it on an [Acer](https://href.li/?http://www.acer.co.nz) notebook and it installed with no problems. I thought this was quite impressive considering the recentness of the notebook. I am currently trying to get my [Linksys WPC54G Version 3](https://href.li/?http://www1.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=507&grid=) going using [ndiswrapper](https://href.li/?http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/) but haven’t been successful yet.
My only complaints are that in my opinion it installs a little too much software by default. For example, it installs Kaquarium, Ksensors, and a whole lot of other utilities that I possibly won’t ever use. I suppose, though, the maintainers of any Linux distribution have to balance ease of installation and the number of applications they will include by default (it was nice,though, to see [Skype](https://href.li/?http://www.skype.com) included in the default install). The base install was about 2 gigabytes, though, and Mepis installs this all to the root partition so ensure you make the root partition large enough.
