Finally, a ‘true blue’ summers evening - clear blue sky and beautiful
sunshine. It stayed light until about 9:30pm tonight and was short
sleeves weather (even at 10:30pm at night!).

We spent the evening at a friend’s house having a 'wine and cheese’
evening with some bros/sis from Germany. It was great having a cultural
exchange, finding out about Germany and hearing about how similar life
is there to [here](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) and also about differences too.
