On November 7-8, 2009, Christchurch, New Zealand will host the first [PyCon](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org) in the Asia Pacific region. The event is being organised by the [NZPUG](https://href.li/?http://www.nzpug.org) and the [call](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/2009/jul/14/call-for-papers/) has already gone out for speakers and potential sponsors. So please if you’re able to help out with either giving a [presentation](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/talks-cfp/call-for-papers/) or [sponsoring](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org/sponsorship/) the event, we’d love to hear from you! (the deadline for speaker proposals is August 2!)
