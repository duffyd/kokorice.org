I've migrated my blog to [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) :tada:.

This is version 5 of this blog. Below I've listed previous versions of this blog:

1. [SimpleBlog running on Plone](/2004/08/09/finally-created-my-first-online-blog/)
2. [Quills running on Plone](/2005/03/25/rehashed-koko-araisa/)
3. [Quills running on Plone](/2005/12/21/kokorice-remixed-v3/)
4. [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
5. [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org)

I am grateful to Tumblr for hosting my blog for around the last 7 years but it is a terrible blogging platform. For e.g. the content editor outputs terrible HTML, the permalinks it generates are strange, etc. So as a result, I really didn't feel like blogging. Needless to say I'm happy to be running my own blogging software again. If you want to have a look at the code running this blog, feel free to browse the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/duffyd/kokorice.org).
