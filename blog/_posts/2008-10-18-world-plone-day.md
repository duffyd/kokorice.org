On **November 7th, 2008** we will stage the first worldwide event to market [Plone](https://href.li/?http://plone.org) to the masses. The event’s objective (according to the [official event page](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/wpd)) is to introduce Plone, via introductory talks, to business, government, NGOs, and universities. The community of developers and consultancies surrounding Plone is second to none and this has been shown once again with the [number of countries](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/events/wpd/2008) rallying together to organise events for World Plone Day - 30 events in 22 countries on 5 continents (and counting).
Here in New Zealand where World Plone Day will see the first light of day, we have 3 events happening nationwide in [Auckland](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/events/wpd/2008/akl), [Wellington](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/events/wpd/2008/wlg), and [Christchurch](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/events/wpd/2008/chc). The number of government Plone sites in New Zealand is huge so I’ve accepted an invitation to give an introductory Plone talk in Wellington (our capital) - thanks to Nate Aune for the [talk material](https://href.li/?http://www.slideshare.net/Jazkarta/10-things-about-plone-software-freedom-day-2008-presentation/)!
Other activities on the day will include: prize giveaways, refreshments, examples of how Plone is being used in the ‘real world’, and opportunities to chat to Plone experts.
A big thanks to all our [sponsors](https://href.li/?http://plone.org/wpd), to Meghan Murphy for the awesome World Plone Day logo, to all those who’ve volunteered their time thus far in organising the events worldwide (and on the day!), and to the great Plone community who foster an environment where all this is possible!
Lets make sure World Plone Day is a roaring success and please share the success of your event with the rest of us by tagging any blog posts, photos, videos, or anything else from the day with ’**worldploneday2008**’.
