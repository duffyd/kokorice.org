**NEW ZEALAND PYTHON USER GROUP**

**Media Statement**

**November 2, 2009**

**IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

“Simplicity, Flexibility, Beauty!” is the theme for Kiwi PyCon 2009, a conference being held this Saturday and Sunday in Christchurch to promote the Python programming language in New Zealand.

Python has been described as the closest programming language to the English language and is therefore very simple to learn. Due to its simplicity, Otago University have decided to teach Python as part of an introductory course to programming and there will be a presentation at the conference regarding how the course has benefited students at the university.

Python also runs the software on the XO laptops, which have been distributed to over a million children in developing countries worldwide as part of the One Laptop Per Child project. There will be a presentation regarding OLPC at the conference including a demonstration of a number of XO laptops in action.

Python’s flexibility will also be highlighted throughout the conference programme, with presentations on how it is being used in the field of animation, in computer games, on cellphones and websites. Some of the presenters at the event will be coming from England, America, and Australia.

“Registrations sold out 4 days prior to the registration closing date” comments Tim Knapp, Conference Director, “which really highlights the great level of interest in the language throughout New Zealand.” The conference starts at 8:30am this Saturday at the Canterbury Innovation Incubator.
