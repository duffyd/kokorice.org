**Kiwi PyCon 2013** will be held at Auckland University of Technology’s new [Sir Paul Reeves Building](https://href.li/?https://www.google.com/maps?q=Sir+Paul+Reeves+Building,+Governor+Fitzroy+Pl,+Auckland,+1010,+New+Zealand&hl=en&ll=-36.853244,174.765776&spn=0.002327,0.003868&sll=-36.85305,174.765492&sspn=0.002327,0.003868&hq=Sir+Paul+Reeves+Building,&hnear=Governor+Fitzroy+Pl,+Auckland,+1010,+New+Zealand&t=m&z=18) in Auckland, New Zealand on September 6-8.

This is the 5th time the conference has been held and as with previous years, it’s aim is to promote the use of the [Python](https://href.li/?http://python.org) programming language in New Zealand and abroad.

A particular target audience we’re trying to reach is entrepreneurs, developers, professionals, students in the IT & Technology sector who aren’t too familiar with Python. We’d like them to come along and see how Python is being used in various areas and therefore how they could make use of it.

We’ve got 2 great keynotes: [Michael Foord](https://href.li/?http://blog.python.org/2011/08/meet-team-michael-foord.html) who will give a Python “State of the Union” - what’s going on with all the implementations and what’s new in Python 3.3 / 3.4, followed by words of wisdom about being - and becoming - a core developer, and [Jessica McKellar](https://href.li/?http://pycon.blogspot.co.nz/2013/02/interview-with-tutorial-presenter.html), who will be talking about the Python community.

For the first time we’ll also have a day dedicated to **tutorials** on the Friday, a **Recruitment Track**, as well as the standard features such as our **CodeWars** event on the Friday night and 2 days packed full of Python talks.

Registration has opened and student/unwaged tickets are *$NZD60* and regular tickets are *$NZD100*. Don’t miss out on this excellent conference! Tickets can be purchased from the [conference website](https://href.li/?http://nz.pycon.org).
