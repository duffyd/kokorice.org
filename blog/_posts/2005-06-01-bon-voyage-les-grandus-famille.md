![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhAMYKbBjA5B1uNPY?embed=1&width=200&height=150)Our [congregation](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/library/jt/article_07.htm) had a farewell for our [Canadian friends](/)
last Saturday. Some highlights were ‘St. Albans Idol’, 'The Custard
Skit’, and 'The Hamster Dance’. It’s really sad to see them go but
we’ve promised to visit them in [Alberta](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta) and sample their Pumpkin Pie.
