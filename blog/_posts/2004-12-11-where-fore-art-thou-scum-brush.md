I haven’t blogged in a [while](/2004/12/04/plone-205-is-out/),
so there’s lots to say. On Wednesday I finished my last scum-brush -
another wonderful invention from Japan (I wouldn’t know how to [google](https://href.li/?http://www.google.com)
for that one, so I’ll just explain what it is). A scum-brush has a
small plastic handle with a wire at one end with bristles on it to get
in to those small nooks-and-crannies between your teeth. We got a
packet of them when we were [last in Japan](/2004/08/21/my-holiday-thus-far/),
and they’ve finally come to an end. Cruelly enough, when I went to the
Dentist today she told me that I will need to shell out $2000 to fix up
my teeth. So I’ve lost my last scum-brush and my teeth are a mess! Oh
well, c'est la vie.

Last Saturday we went up to [Lake Coleridge](https://href.li/?http://www.lakecoleridgenz.info/)
to do country witnessing. I wouldn’t say it was a ground-shattering
experience but it was nice to get out into the countryside and enjoy
the scenery (even though it did hail while we were out there). BTW if
you are out that way, I would definitely recommend the Hororata Cafe -
they do splendifirous icecreams!

I also spent most of today working on a [LinguaPlone](https://href.li/?http://www.plonesolutions.com/products/linguaplone/) site for a customer (I’ll unveil it soon). In the process, I did learn that there is a ‘settings’ tab in [formulator](https://href.li/?http://www.infrae.com/download/Formulator)
that allows you to specify that the form is encoded in 'UTF-8’ which
will allow you to enter Japanese/Korean/etc characters! Cool, ay. I’ve
also started a 'Techie Stuff’ section on this site where I’ll chuck any
howtos or other helpful stuff I find out during the course of my
work/playing around.
