We had a great time and there was about 25+ that came along.

It doesn’t matter how [many](/) [times](/) I farewell someone I never really get used to it. This couple, Songwan and Songhi, were always out in the [ministry](https://href.li/?http://www.watchtower.org/library/jt/article_05.htm),
were a real delight to be around and helped me to improve my Korean
language skills! I have set a goal, though, to one day visit them and
the [Hite](https://href.li/?http://english.hite.com/) factory in [Jeonju](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeonju) one day.
