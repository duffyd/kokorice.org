Well I know for sure that George Harrison didn’t get any inspiration from Christchurch when he wrote his song - [Here Comes the Sun](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002UB3/104-5307872-2061561?v=glance).
So far, we’ve had the worst summer on record. The temperatures have
been down in single digits and its been raining and hailing like crazy.
I don’t like to remind myself that it’s summer because I feel like I’m
being cheated out of a summer. Hopefully, at the very least, next month
will ‘sun up’ and summer will really begin (fingers-crossed).

I’ve also been a bit crook lately. My dentist prescribed me some
antibiotics which didn’t agree with my system and I had dysentry for
about a week (fun fun).

We also had another dog (Sakura) come to stay over the weekend and it was funny watching [Chocolat](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhA1hwR0uEL13r-7t?e=e7fGxk) and Sakura playing together.
