Well, it’s the ‘morning after’ our long-awaited Chihuahua puppy (i.e.

 Chocolat) has landed at Papanui, Christchurch. Miho got back from her 3 day

 jaunt to Auckland yesterday and brought the bundle-of-joy with her. She’s

 amazingingly cute! I did think she was going to be cute but not this cute

 (she’s a puppy 'model’!). But hey, I’m probably biased, because it’s mine

 after all. More photos to come. ![image](https://dm2301files.storage.live.com/y4mKMFNPvnNkIV1c7IUVMc3WQ0QvztApkMwZEDrzOnHjy4hlEQ25UTmAYha-0TkRRsQF7fPwHbD2PrNtAnUwCuRZh4XrNr5fHQROxFWN0X4mK9jD1S6Ra6e_gmyIiYE-wltCAyZRUSbHIe2EEGK2rQrfl-Gl5Pnh1nz0RV0CtoLM5T3mZpQ5h6pTRqlk827CmTl?width=180&height=240&cropmode=none)

I also bought a web camera on Tuesday this week so I’ll be able to have video chats with our relies abroad.
