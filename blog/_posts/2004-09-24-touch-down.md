Well, it’s the ‘morning after’ our long-awaited Chihuahua puppy (i.e. Chocolat) has landed at Papanui, Christchurch. Miho got back from her 3 day jaunt to Auckland yesterday and brought the bundle-of-joy with her. She’s amazingingly cute! I did think she was going to be cute but not this cute (she’s a puppy 'model’!). But hey, I’m probably biased, because it’s mine after all. More photos to come.![image](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AsJfVUEHse4xhAQEojq9bGClsZbF?embed=1&width=180&height=240)

I also bought a web camera on Tuesday this week so I’ll be able to have video chats with our relies abroad.
