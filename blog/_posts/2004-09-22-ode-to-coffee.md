As I sit here having my traditional first cappuccino of the day, I’m
 thinking I should write something about this beverage that brings so much
 pleasure to me day in and day out.

I start my morning off with a cappuccino made with coffee from [hummingbird coffee](https://href.li/?http://www.freshcoffee.co.nz/home.html) (an
 absolutely wonderful drop). As an aside, I buy their house blend, which is
 called [Italian
 Espresso](https://href.li/?http://www.freshcoffee.co.nz/blendsandroasts.html), and I just found out last weekend that about a 1/3 of this
 blend is made up of [Ethiopian Harrar](https://href.li/?http://www.google.com/search?q=Ethiopian+Harrar)
 beans - which apparently is the best coffee bean in the world! No wonder
 it’s so nice! I also make it in my [Bialetti](https://href.li/?http://www.bialetti.com/) stove-top espresso maker (Moka
 Express) which gives me a sense of satisfaction as well :). Then it’s just a
 matter of heating a half cup of milk in the microwave for about 1 minute
 10s, plunging the milk about 10x in a coffee plunger and ‘wa la’ you’ve got
 a vundabar cappuccino to guzzle. Speaking about cappus, I’ve just finished
 my 1st, time for a top up.
