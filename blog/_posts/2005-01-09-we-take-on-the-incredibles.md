I organised a group of 22 of our friends to go and see [The Incredibles](https://href.li/?http://www.theincredibles.com/) at the newly refurbished [Northlands Hoyts 6](https://href.li/?http://hoytsnz.ninemsn.com.au/cinema/1NTH.asp). Its got so much leg room you can sit on the edge of your seat and stretch your legs right out and you can’t touch the seats in front! We took out 2 rows at the cinema and it was really great to have all your friends sitting together enjoying a movie together (even if you don’t really talk to eachother during the movie ;-)

I would recommend the movie to anyone and give it my offical ‘2 thumbs up’ rating. I especially liked the Incredibles’ son, dash, and how he could run on water and beat up the bad guys because he could quickly dodge their punches.
