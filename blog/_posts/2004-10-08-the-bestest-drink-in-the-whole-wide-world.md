I just bought a bottle (500ml) of [Ribena](https://href.li/?http://www.ribena.co.nz) concentrate last night and
 reminded myself how much I love this drink. According to the label, 100% of
 the blackcurrant berries that are used in New Zealand Ribena are from the
 South Island - good on ya southies :) I think I was pretty much weaned on
 the stuff when I was a baby (according to Mumsy), which probably explains my
 attachment to it now. Funnily enough, though, I found an alternative brand
 of Blackcurrant juice called [
 Barkers](https://href.li/?https://www.barkers.co.nz/index.cfm/Shop_Products/Fruit_Juices___Syrups_750ml/Blackcurrant%5FSyrup%5F750ml.html) which I actually like more than Ribena & it is a [southern company](https://href.li/?http://www.barkers.co.nz) too.

 Anyways, there are many ways to have blackcurrant juice, but my favourite
 is hot. You should try it some time!
