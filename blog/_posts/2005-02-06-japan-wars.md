Was reading through an email I got from a [Star Wars mailing list](https://href.li/?http://www.starwars.com/site/homingbeacon/) I subscribe to and found out this interesting [piece](https://href.li/?http://www.starwars.com/gaming/videogames/news/f20050128/index.html):

the artist looked to the Ralph McQuarrie-designed stormtrooper suit, which itself had been inspired by samurai armor

According to the same article, apparently the new [Clone Commando](https://href.li/?http://www.starwars.com/databank/organization/clonecommando/) is also partly inspired by the [ninja](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja). So those of you who are Japan buffs, here’s some interesting trivia for your friends :-)
BTW if you do read Japanese, there’s [now](https://href.li/?http://www.starwars.com/site/news/2004/12/news20041217.html) a [Star Wars Japan](https://href.li/?http://starwarsjapan.com/) website for your viewing pleasure!
