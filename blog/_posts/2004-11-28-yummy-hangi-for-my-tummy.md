Went to a [hangi](https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangi) last night.
 I think I can only count on 2-3 fingers the number of hangis I’ve eaten in
 my life and this one was one I’m going to be reminiscing over for some time.
 That wonderful smokey / earthy taste is incomparable to any other type of
 food.

 Also found another [good
 article](https://href.li/?http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2004/09/23/plone_features.html) containing an intro to Plone. Too, looking at [svn](https://href.li/?http://subversion.tigris.org) on [Etria](https://href.li/?http://www.etria.com) it looks like the long awaited [0.9](https://href.li/?http://svn.etria.com/Quills/trunk/version.txt) version of
 Quills is out! I feel a kokorice upgrade coming on :-)
